Priya loves bitwise AND, but she hates programming. Help her solve this problem.

Given an array A of size N, let Bij denote the bitwise AND of A[i] and A[j]. You have to find the number of pairs (i,j), such that i<j and Bij=A[i].

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case consists of a single integer N, denoting the Size of Array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...AN.
Output:
For each test case, output a single line, count of such pairs.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
1≤A[i]≤100

Sample Input:
2
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
10

Sample Output:
10
0

Explanation
Example case 1: Number of valid pairs are -(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5) and (4,5). Therefore, total valid pairs =10.

Example case 2: Since N=1, therefore there are no valid pairs.
